  abstract = {La idea de meritocracia est\'a relacionada con la distribuci\'on de bienes y beneficios basada en el talento y esfuerzo individual, constituyendo un principio que legitima la distribuci\'on desigual de los recursos en sociedades modernas. Pese a las constantes referencias a la meritocracia en la investigaci\'on de desigualdad y estratificaci\'on social en sociolog\'ia, existen pocos intentos conceptuales y emp\'iricos que busquen entender hasta qu\'e punto los individuos perciben y prefieren la meritocracia, as\'i como tambi\'en sus consecuencias. La presente investigaci\'on propone un marco conceptual y emp\'irico para el estudio de las percepciones y preferencias meritocr\'aticas que, posteriormente, es relacionado con una serie de variables relativas a la desigualdad social. Utilizando datos de la encuesta chilena ``Justicia social y participaci\'on ciudadana'' (N= 1.245), los resultados del an\'alisis sugieren que las preferencias y percepciones de la meritocracia son constructos distintos y que quienes perciben un adecuado funcionamiento de la meritocracia tambi\'en perciben menos desigualdad social.},

I begin by describing different ways of measuring perceptions of inequality, and conclude that absolute measures\textemdash which ask respondents to estimate inequality in more concrete terms\textemdash tend to be more useful and accurate than relative measures.  I then describe how people understand inequality, highlighting the roles of cognitive heuristics, accessibility of information, self-interest, and context and culture.  I review the evidence regarding how people react to inequality, suggesting that inequality is associated with higher well-being in developing nations but lower well-being in developed nations, mostly because of hopes or fears for the future.  The evidence from developed nations suggests that inequality increases individuals' concerns about status and economic resources, increases their perception that the social world is competitive and individualistic, and erodes their faith in others, political systems, and democracy in general.},

  abstract = {This article explores the association between intergenerational social mobility and attitudes towards income differences in post-socialist societies. I hypothesise that based on the psychological mechanism of self-serving bias in causal attribution, those who experience upward social mobility are more likely to support greater income differences, and that subjective intergenerational mobility has stronger association with attitudes towards income differences than objective mobility because individuals filter their objective environment in order to derive their subjective perceptions of the world and their own experiences. The described hypotheses are tested with two cross-national data sets \textendash{} European Values Studies and Life in Transition Survey. The derived findings are robust to alternative statistical specifications and indicate that individuals who perceive themselves as subjectively mobile have significantly different attitudes towards income differences in comparison to non-mobile groups, but that this effect does not manifest among objectively mobile individuals.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This study reviews international comparative studies investigating people's views on inequality. These studies are classified using a framework consisting of three types of conceptions of inequality and two dimensions of inequality. Four perspectives are discussed explaining cross-national differences in views on inequality: the modernist, the culturalist, the micro and the macro perspective. The findings of studies comparing views on inequalities in post-communist and Western states provide more support for the modernist than for the culturalist perspective. Few comparative studies appear to investigate views on inequalities as independent variables impacting on other social attitudes and behaviours. It is argued that the social relevance of the field will be enhanced if more studies can show that views on inequality have an effect on social outcomes complementary to that of objective inequalities.           ,              R\'esum\'e             L'\'etude fait le tour des comparaisons internationales qui ont analys\'e les opinions sur l'in\'egalit\'e. On peut les classer \`a partir de trois conceptions de l'in\'egalit\'e et de deux dimensions. On obtient en fait quatre mod\`eles qui rendent compte des diff\'erences entre nations : le moderniste, le culturaliste, la perspective micro et la perspective macro. Les donn\'ees comparatives pour les pays ex-communistes et les pays occidentaux s'accordent mieux avec une perspective moderniste que culturaliste. Les \'etudes comparatives ont fort peu trait\'e les jugements sur l'in\'egalit\'e comme variables ind\'ependantes ayant un impact sur d'autres attitudes et comportements sociaux. La pertinence sociale de ce champ d'\'etudes serait augment\'ee si davantage d'\'etudes montraient que les jugements sur l'in\'egalit\'e ont des effets sociaux qui s'ajoutent \`a ceux des in\'egalit\'es objectives.           ,              Zusammenfassung             Dieser Beitrag interessiert sich f\"ur internationale vergleichende Studien, die die Anschauungen \"uber Ungleichheit zum Thema haben. Diese Studien lassen sich in drei Konzepte und zwei Dimensionen von Ungleichheit einteilen. Daraus entstehen vier Modelle, die die unterschiedlichen nationalen Betrachtungsweisen von Ungleichheit erkl\"aren: die modernistische Perspektive, die kulturelle Perspektive, die Mikroperspektive und die Makroperspektive. Die vergleichenden Angaben ehemaliger kommunistischer und westlicher L\"ander stimmen eher mit der modernistischen als mit der kulturalistischen Perspektive \"uberein. Nur wenige der vergleichenden Studien scheinen Ungleichheiten als unabh\"angige Variablen zu verstehen, die zu anderen sozialen Formen und Verhaltensweisen f\"uhren k\"onnten. Die soziale Bedeutung dieses Studienbereichs k\"onnte zunehmen, falls mehrere Untersuchungen zeigen w\"urden, dass die Einstufungen der Ungleichheit soziale Auswirkungen haben, die zu den objektiven Ungleichheiten hinzugef\"ugt werden m\"ussen.},

  abstract = {Economic inequality has been on the rise in the United States since the 1980s and by some measures stands at levels not seen since before the Great Depression. Although the strikingly high and rising level of economic inequality in the nation has alarmed scholars, pundits, and elected officials alike, research across the social sciences repeatedly concludes that Americans are largely unconcerned about it. Considerable research has documented, for instance, the important role of psychological processes, such as system justification and American Dream ideology, in engendering Americans' relative insensitivity to economic inequality. The present work offers, and reports experimental tests of, a different perspective\textemdash the opportunity model of beliefs about economic inequality. Specifically, two convenience samples (study 1,               n               = 480; and study 2,               n               = 1,305) and one representative sample (study 3,               n               = 1,501) of American adults were exposed to information about rising economic inequality in the United States (or control information) and then asked about their beliefs regarding the roles of structural (e.g., being born wealthy) and individual (e.g., hard work) factors in getting ahead in society (i.e., opportunity beliefs). They then responded to policy questions regarding the roles of business and government actors in reducing economic inequality. Rather than revealing insensitivity to rising inequality, the results suggest that rising economic inequality in contemporary society can spark skepticism about the existence of economic opportunity in society that, in turn, may motivate support for policies designed to redress economic inequality.},

Despite what scholars and journalists consider a worrying trend, there is no evidence of growing popular concern about inequality. In fact, research suggests that citizens in unequal societies are less concerned than those in more egalitarian societies. How to make sense of this paradox? I argue that citizens' consent to inequality is explained by their growing conviction that societal success is reflective of a meritocratic process. Drawing on 25 years of International Social Survey Program data, I show that rising inequality is legitimated by the popular belief that the income gap is meritocratically deserved: the more unequal a society, the more likely its citizens are to explain success in meritocratic terms, and the less important they deem nonmeritocratic factors such as a person's family wealth and connections.},

However, regarding meritocratic beliefs, sociologists often argue that meritocratic narratives legitimize and make sense of societal inequalities as justly deserved. Using the case of China, I tested these competing hypotheses of the relationship between parental meritocratic beliefs and children's educational achievement. Parental beliefs about skills and hard work as predictors of higher grades were used. I analyzed data from the first and second waves of the China Educational Panel Survey. Autoregressive cross-lagged structural models indicated that parental meritocratic beliefs do not affect children's educational performance but, rather, meritocratic beliefs are affected by academic results, suggesting their justificatory role. This pattern is much sharper in rural China, where traditional Chinese culture is preserved. The implications of meritocratic beliefs for a broader discussion of citizens' beliefs about social inequalities and stratification are discussed.},

Sense of Justice, defined as the relationship between one's actual reward and his/her deserved reward, is reflected in three interrelated but distinct categories: instrumental, relational and procedural. The study was carried out in Israel among over 5000 middle school students in a national sample of 48 public schools. Findings basically support our hypothesis that students, who feel that they were treated fairly by their teachers, will be more trustful. However, these relationships are differential in the comparison of students in three school's sectors: Jewish general, Jewish religious, and Arab.},
